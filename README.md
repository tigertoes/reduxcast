# Reduxcast
If you don't know what Redux is and don't have an account, this extension is no
use to you. If you do have an account and you don't have a Chromecast, this
extension is equally as worthless. Still here? You'll also need Chrome with the
Chromecast extension installed.

## Get started
Clone out the repo, enable Developer mode under chrome://extensions and "load
unpacked extension", supplying it the base directory of the repository. Until
this uses a custom sender/receiver, you should not need your Chromecast unlocked
for development.

## TODO
* Clean up attrocious code
* Create a custom receiver instead of using the default
* Make installation easy as possible
* Use the Redux API instead of scraping from page
* Subtitle support
